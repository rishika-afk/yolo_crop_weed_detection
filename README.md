## Introduction

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image. YOLO is a popular deep learning model for real-time object detection. This notebook explores the implementation of the YOLO model and its optimization using different techniques.

## YOLO Model

The YOLO model is implemented using the YOLOv8 architecture. The notebook includes code for loading a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, training the model on custom data, and performing inference for object detection tasks.

## YOLO with Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian optimization is a sequential model-based optimization technique that aims to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning model. This section of the notebook demonstrates how to use Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, to tune the hyperparameters of the YOLO model using Bayesian optimization.

## YOLO with CSO

CSO (Crow Search Optimization) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of crow species. This section of the notebook explores the use of CSO to optimize the hyperparameters of the YOLO model for improved performance in object detection tasks.
